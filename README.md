# Operating-Platforms

The Gaming Room was looking to create a web application that would allow users to input answers to prompts. The client wanted to expand from only Android to all platforms
allowing them to market to a larger audience and make the game bigger. They wanted to come in under budget with these changes, and I helped with planning and execution. The
requirements they put in place were a challenge to overcome, but I think I managed to fullfil the code that they were looking for in a strong way. I'm no expert at Java, but
I feel like my code was professional and well documented for anyone who may need to make changes.
